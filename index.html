	<h1>Hi there, I'm Yuvraj Sharma!</h1>
	<p>I am very curious about data and the science around it. My interests lie in Computer Vision, NLP and Audio processing. Outside my day job as a Data Scientist, I am mostly found trying out new and exciting avenues to learn data science, exploring interesting and upcoming NN architectures, and trying my hands on different tools and languages every now and then. Please refer the <a href="/about">About</a> section to learn more about me. <br><br>This is my <em> Blog </em> page, where I would write an ocassional tidbit about ML things I am trying to learn or explore on my own. Give it a read and please bear with me while I try incredibly slowly to add more content to this page. <a href="/blog">Read Blogs here...</a></p>
