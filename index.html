	<h1>Hi there, I'm Yuvraj Sharma!</h1>
	<p>I am very curious about data and science around it. I have interests in Computer Vision and NLP, and I wrote my postgraduate thesis on improving multispectral satellite image processing. Outside my day-job as a Data Scientist, I am mostly found trying out new and exciting avenues to learn data science, learning about interesting and upcoming architectures, trying my hands on different tools and languages every now and then. This is my <em> blog </em> page, where I woould write an ocassional tidbit about things I am trying to learn or explore. Give it a read and please bear with me while I try to ad more content to this page incredibly slowly... <a href="/blog">Read more about my work...</a></p>
