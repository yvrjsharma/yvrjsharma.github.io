<h1>Hi there, I'm Yuvraj Sharma!</h1>
	<p>I am a data science practitioner. Computer Vision and NLP both fascinate me. Outside my day job as a Data Scientist, I am mostly found trying out new and exciting avenues to learn data science, exploring interesting and upcoming NN architectures,  building fun little projects on HuggingFace Spaces and trying my hands on different tools and languages every now and then. Some of the ML demos that I have build can be fouund over here - https://huggingface.co/ysharma <br><br> Please refer the <em>About </em> section of my <em> Blog </em> page to learn more about me. There I would write an ocassional tidbit about ML things I am trying to learn or explore on my own. Give it a read and please bear with me while I try incredibly slowly to add more content to this page. </p>
